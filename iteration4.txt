Iteration 4 – UI Polish, Game Feedback, and Code Cleanup

Goal:
-----
Make the game nicer to use and easier to maintain: improve visual layout,
add feedback, and tidy up the code structure.

High-Level Requirements:
------------------------
1. Visual improvements:
   - Arrange the table layout with clear sections:
     - Dealer area (name, cards, total).
     - Player area (name, cards, total, balance, bet).
   - Use basic styling (CSS) for:
     - Cards (simple boxes or Unicode suits).
     - Buttons and status messages.
2. Clear game feedback:
   - Visually highlight wins/losses/pushes (e.g., colored text or small animation).
   - Indicate current phase: "Place your bet", "Your turn", "Dealer's turn", "Round over".
   - Show error messages for invalid bets (e.g., "Bet must be > 0 and <= balance").
3. Code cleanup & separation of concerns:
   - Keep DOM-manipulation logic in a UI/controller section (or a UI helper class)
     instead of scattering it across all classes.
   - Ensure Game class coordinates actions and exposes clear methods like:
     - init()
     - onBetPlaced(amount)
     - onPlayerHit()
     - onPlayerStand()
   - Avoid direct DOM access from Card/Hand/Player classes; they should focus on data and logic.
4. Basic robustness:
   - Prevent clicking Hit/Stand buttons during dealer turn or when round is not active.
   - Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., double-clicking buttons, starting new round mid-round).
   - Console should be relatively free of errors and unused logs.

Optional Stretch Goals (only if time permits):
----------------------------------------------
- Add a simple "statistics" area:
  - Number of rounds played, wins, losses, pushes.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for Hit (H), Stand (S), New Round (N).
- Add a simple "settings" section where the starting balance can be changed.

Acceptance Criteria:
--------------------
- The game looks organized and readable on screen (not just raw text).
- Player always knows whose turn it is and what to do next.
- No obvious race conditions or invalid-button-state issues in normal play.
- Code is organized into:
  - Core model classes (Card, Shoe, Hand, Player, Dealer),
  - Game controller logic,
  - UI/DOM update functions (or a dedicated UI helper).
