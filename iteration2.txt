Iteration 2 – Full Single-Round Blackjack Logic (Hit/Stand, Dealer Turn, Round Outcome)

Goal:
-----
Implement the core blackjack rules for a single hand: hit/stand, dealer drawing rules,
and determining the winner of a round.

High-Level Requirements:
------------------------
1. The player must be able to control actions via buttons:
   - "Hit" – player draws a card.
   - "Stand" – player ends their turn.
2. Implement blackjack total rules with Aces:
   - Ace counts as 11 if it does not cause bust; otherwise counts as 1.
   - Hand.getTotal() must compute the best possible total <= 21 if possible.
3. Player turn:
   - Game starts with 2 cards each (from Iteration 1).
   - While player’s turn is active:
     - "Hit" adds a card to the player hand and updates the display.
     - If player total > 21, player busts immediately and the round ends.
4. Dealer turn:
   - Dealer has one face-up and one face-down card.
   - After player stands (and is not bust):
     - Reveal dealer’s hidden card.
     - Dealer draws cards until total >= 17 (typical rule: hit on <17, stand on 17+).
5. Determine round result:
   - If player busts: dealer wins.
   - If dealer busts: player wins.
   - Otherwise, compare totals:
     - Higher total wins.
     - Equal totals = push (tie).
6. Display outcome on the page:
   - Show a message like "Player wins!", "Dealer wins!", or "Push."
   - Show final totals for player and dealer.

OOP Design Changes/Extensions:
------------------------------
- class Hand
  - Update getTotal() to handle Aces as 1 or 11.
- class Dealer
  - Add method playTurn(shoe) that implements the “hit until >=17” rule.
- class Game
  - Add methods:
    - startNewRound()           // deal cards, reset state, set current turn to Player
    - playerHit()
    - playerStand()
    - checkForRoundEnd()        // determines if bust or compare totals
    - endRound(outcome)         // sets a gameResult state and updates UI

UI Requirements:
----------------
- Buttons:
  - "New Round" (or "Deal")
  - "Hit"
  - "Stand"
- "Hit" and "Stand" buttons should only be enabled during the player’s turn.
- After round ends, "Hit" and "Stand" are disabled until the next round starts.
- Dealer’s second card should appear as hidden (e.g., "??") during player’s turn and then revealed.

Acceptance Criteria:
--------------------
- Player can play a complete hand from initial deal through outcome with Hit/Stand.
- Dealer follows the rule “draw until total >= 17”.
- Aces are correctly counted as 1 or 11 to give the best valid total.
- Round outcome is clearly visible (who won, with what totals).
- After a round, player can start a new round without page reload.
