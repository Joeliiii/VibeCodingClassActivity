Iteration 1 – Core OOP Model & Basic Dealing (No Full Game Logic Yet)

Goal:
-----
Set up the object-oriented backbone of the game and prove that we can create a 6-deck shoe,
deal initial cards to player and dealer, and display them in the browser (even if just as text).

High-Level Requirements:
------------------------
1. The game must run in a browser using JavaScript (no backend).
2. The code must be written in an object-oriented style using ES6 classes.
3. There must be a representation of:
   - A Card (rank + suit + value for blackjack)
   - A Shoe (6 combined decks of 52 cards, shuffled)
   - A Hand (collection of cards + ability to compute total)
   - A Player and Dealer (each has a Hand)
   - A Game controller object (coordinates the above)
4. When the page loads, the game must:
   - Create a 6-deck Shoe and shuffle it.
   - Deal 2 cards to the Player.
   - Deal 2 cards to the Dealer (both visible for now; hidden card can come later).
5. The current state (Player hand, Dealer hand) must be rendered to the page in a simple way
   (e.g., text in <div> elements).

OOP Design Hints:
-----------------
- class Card
  - Properties: rank (2–10, J, Q, K, A), suit (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣ or strings), value (2–10, 10, 11).
  - Methods: toString() for display.

- class Shoe
  - Properties: cards (array of Card).
  - Methods:
    - constructor(numDecks = 6)
    - buildDecks()  // pushes 6*52 cards into cards
    - shuffle()
    - drawCard()    // returns one card from the top of the shoe

- class Hand
  - Properties: cards (array of Card).
  - Methods:
    - addCard(card)
    - getTotal()    // basic total for now; Aces can just be 11 in this iteration
    - toString()

- class Participant (abstract/base)
  - Properties: name, hand (Hand).

- class Player extends Participant
- class Dealer extends Participant

- class Game
  - Properties: shoe (Shoe), player (Player), dealer (Dealer).
  - Methods:
    - startNewRoundSkeleton() // for now, just deal 2 cards to each

User-Facing Behavior:
---------------------
- When the player opens the page:
  - They see:
    - “Player Hand: [card list] – Total: X”
    - “Dealer Hand: [card list] – Total: Y”
  - No buttons or game actions required yet.

Acceptance Criteria:
--------------------
- Card, Shoe, Hand, Player, Dealer, Game are implemented as ES6 classes.
- Shoe contains 6*52 = 312 cards before dealing.
- Shuffling is performed at least once at the start.
- Two cards are dealt to player and dealer each, drawn from Shoe.
- Hands and totals are displayed in the browser (not just console).
